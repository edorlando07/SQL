Find the first and last name of each customer who has placed at least 
6 orders between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Order your results 
by the number of orders placed in descending order. (Hint: You will need 
to join to three tables â€“ Sales.SalesOrderHeader, Sales.Customer, and 
Person.Person. You will use every clause to complete this query).
