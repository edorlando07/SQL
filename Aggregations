Join the Production.Product table and the Production.ProductInventory 
table for only the products that appear in both table. Use the ProductID 
as the joining column. Production.ProductInventory contains the quantity 
of each product (several rows can appear for each product to indicate the 
product appears in multiple locations). Your goal is to determine how much 
money we would earn if we sold every product for its list price for each 
product with a ListPrice greater than $0. That is, if you summed the product 
of each productâ€™s inventory by its list price, what would that value be? 
(Hint: This is intentionally challenging. You must use an aggregate function 
with a mathematical expression to accomplish your goal)

WHERE P.ListPrice > 0
