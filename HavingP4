Starting with the Sales.SalesOrderHeader table, join to the Sales.SalesOrderDetail 
table. This table contains the line item details associated with each sale. 
From Sales.SalesOrderDetail, join to the Production.Product table. Return the 
Name column from Production.Product and assign it the column alias “Product Name”. 
For each product, find out how many of each product was ordered for all orders that 
occurred in 2006. Only output those products where at least 200 were ordered.
