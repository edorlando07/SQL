Using Sales.SalesOrderHeader, how many sales occurred in each territory 
between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006? Order the results by the sale 
count in descending order

Expanding on the previous example, group the results not by the TerritoryID 
but by the name of the territory (found in the Sales.SalesTerritory table).
